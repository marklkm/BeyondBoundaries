                        <p>
                          Art transcends boundaries and speaks a universal language
                          understood by all. It's a powerful tool that connects diverse
                          communities, celebrates unique perspectives, and embraces
                          inclusivity. We believe art should be accessible to everyone,
                          regardless of background, ability, or circumstance. It's not
                          just about viewing art; it's about experiencing it, creating it,
                          and being part of a community that values every voice.

            <p>
              Do you persevere, or have these struggles defeated you.<br />
              Do you envision, or have these delusions misguided you.
            </p>

            <p>
              Why do you seek something external to yourself,<br />
              Are you too concerned with what was and what will be.
            </p>

            <p>
              If I pushed you down that cliff, would you be able to climb
              again.<br />
              If I let you through this gate, would you be able to dream
              again.<br />
              Or would you become hollow.
            </p>

            <p>
              Obstacle advances Action,<br />
              Ambition advances Conscience,<br />
              What are you if not consciously acting.
            </p>

            <p>
              Once you pass this gate, there will only be the untrodden,<br />
              Each step will make a mark, on you, as much as where you walk.<br />
              I cannot give you freedom, for you must take it with your own
              hands.
            </p>

            <p>
              Beyond this gate, none will oppose you,<br />
              Because you have no enemies
            </p>

              by Alex Martin
            </h2>
            <p>
              A day of fear is here my face white as a ghost.<br />
              She smiles at me, and she takes my hand, as she brings me to my
              seat.<br />
              I would love to have friends of my own,<br />
              but I only have my family,<br />
              there's something about me that this classroom doesn't see,<br />
              A happy loving guy just watching life go by, but is he
              actually,<br />
              or is he just putting it on for show?<br />
              look at me what do you see!<br />
              I might do things at a slower pace,<br />
              but life isn't always a race.<br />
              The struggles been real,<br />
              but I just had to deal.<br />
              Secondary school wasn't great because I never had a mate.<br />
              But a new chapter begins.<br />
              I'll keep fighting and hope to see.<br />
              That all people with disabilities will get opportunities like
              me.<br />
              I count myself lucky to be one of the few that get to go to
              Trinity.

              Must Climb (2022) ~ by Faolán Doecke Launders
            </h2>
            <p>
              Steep, cracked, and jagged, it stands,<br />
              Taller than the clouds, wider than the seas.<br />
              The night sky looms overhead, yet there are no stars,<br />
              While dark and grey clouds slip down its rough edges.<br />
              The only light peeks from within the cracks along its face,<br />
              As if trying to reach out its arms to me
            </p>

            <h3>
              All I know is that I must climb.
            </h3>

            <p>
              Even if I lose grip and slip,<br />
              Even if debris comes crashing down,<br />
              Even if my hands bruise, my bones crack, my arms tear,<br />
              I must keep my hold.
            </p>

            <p>
              When does this end, where does this even bring me.<br />
              Why must I climb at all.<br />
              As I climb, I begin to lose myself,<br />
              Until I find a crack of light, a window of brightness that pierces
              from the other side,<br />
              When I look in, I see everyone, I see you, peaceful, joyful,<br />
              Yet you do not look back at me, you cannot see me,<br />
              It is then that I find myself, and I recall why I am here, and why
              I am climbing at all,
            </p>

            <p>
              So that one day, I can reach this summit,<br />
              And on that day,<br />
              I will finally be able to truly say Hello,<br />
              I will finally be able to Laugh and Live,<br />
              I will finally be able to be the best version of myself
            </p>

            <p>
              And all that I hope, is that when I see you on that summit,<br />
              You'll still be there to say Hello back.
            </p>

            <p>
              Upon reaching the gate, I first saw him.<br />
              While others passed the gate, I was stopped,<br />
              By him.
            </p>

            <p>
              His body devours light, Only his bleak outline can be seen.<br />
              His lifeless eyes fixated on you, With a sword in his hand.<br />
              He guards the gateway.
            </p>

            <p>
              When I try to pass, He shoves me back.<br />
              When I try to run, He hunts me down.<br />
              When I try to fight, He strikes me last.
            </p>

            <p>
              He lets all others pass him, He is only focused on me.<br />
              He knows my every move, No matter what I try.
            </p>

            <p>
              I asked him his name once, Grinning with razor teeth,<br />
              He looks me in the eye, Pulls off his cloak,<br />
              Revealing his face to me.
            </p>

            <p>
              It was at that moment, That I understood.<br />
              For the face that I saw, Was my very own.
            </p>

            <p>
              Then I remembered,<br />
              Told to me by my kin.<br />
              Our only true enemy,<br />
              Is the one within.

                      </h2>
                      <p>
                        Having access to my community,<br />
                        For a person with a disability,<br /> 
                        Means I can participate to the best of my ability. 
                      </p>
          
                      <p>
                        Recently I discovered Crann, <br />
                          A place where I can go for a chat, <br />
                          Over a cup of tea or coffee, <br />
                          And some sweet snacks. 
                      </p>
          
                      <p>
                        Crann designed Ireland's first fully accessible playground & leisure area,  <br />
                        For people with Neuro-physical disabilities, <br />
                        As they saw the world needed to open more opportunities, <br />
                        To allow us to come together as one in our communities. <br />
                        Before I began my time in Trinity, <br />
                        I applied for a job in my local community. <br />
                        It was in a café that employs people with intellectual disabilities,<br />
                        but I was told I would not be employed,<br />
                        as I did not fit their description of a person with a disability.
                      </p>
          
                      <p>
                        So, my journey from Cork to Dublin was meant to be, <br />
                        As there was no suitable 3rd level education for me. <br />
                        I didn't think I passed my interview, <br />
                        As at this point, I was totally lost in my capabilities. 
                      </p>
          
                      <p>
                        The Trinity panel saw something in me, <br />
                        Now I am part of their community.  
                      </p>
          
                      <p>
                        As time goes on,  <br />
                        I began to see, <br />
                        That I can do whatever I want, <br />
                        With some readjustments, <br />
                        I will succeed. 
                      </p>

            <h3>Rhys Merriman</h3>
            <p>
              People with disabilities have their rights effected everyday. For instance People in wheelchairs might not have access
              to shops, transportation and schools. Most public transport only has space for one wheelchair on it.
              People who travel on planes for a holiday will have to organise for someone to meet them at the end of their flight
              to hlpe them off the plane. Sometimes there are extreme delays and they can be left sitting on the plane
              for an hour. People in wheelchairs have the right to live their lives as normal as possible. They should not
              have obstacles in their way.
            </p>
            <p>
              I try to translate the people in wheelchairs of trying to 
              know how they can live like other people and how they can overcome any sorts of obstacles that get in their 
              way even knowing how they can handle any sort of situations that they get into and how they can cope with it.
            </p>
