                        <p>
                          Art transcends boundaries and speaks a universal language
                          understood by all. It's a powerful tool that connects diverse
                          communities, celebrates unique perspectives, and embraces
                          inclusivity. We believe art should be accessible to everyone,
                          regardless of background, ability, or circumstance. It's not
                          just about viewing art; it's about experiencing it, creating it,
                          and being part of a community that values every voice.

               of someone with ADHD, where time management and the ability to respond promptly can be a challenge. 
               The swirling vortex may symbolise the whirlwind of thoughts and distractions that can lead to procrastination 
               or delayed responses. The checkerboard elements, defying gravity and order, represents the non-linear thinking 
               and difficulty in maintaining task structure that individuals with ADHD often experience. The discarded 
               tissues indicates past efforts or attempts to address issues that haven't quite succeeded, 
               adding to the sense of chaos and disarray. The overall composition conveys a sense of waiting,
               contemplation, and the disjointed passage of time.

              <span style="font-weight: 600">DESCRIPTION "Artificial Intelligence":</span> The cover portrays a caricatured hand holding a bottle labeled 
              <span style="font-weight: 600">"Artificial Intelligence"</span>  which is being poured over a computer that appears overwhelmed or malfunctioning,
               with its contents spilling out uncontrollably. This could be seen as a metaphor for the experience of 
               a person with ADHD, where the AI symbolises a flood of information or stimuli. Just as the computer 
               is unable to contain the influx from the bottle, an individual with ADHD might feel similarly inundated by 
               sensory input or rapid thoughts, struggling to filter and process them effectively. The scattered components 
               and the unplugged cable might represent the challenges of organising tasks and staying connected to a single 
               activity or thought process. The "J'accuse!" speech bubble implies an accusation or calling out, possibly alluding 
               to the critical discourse on the impact of AI or to the inner criticism that individuals with ADHD might confront when 
               managing their symptoms.

              <span style="font-weight: 600">DESCRIPTION "1000 Prompts":</span> The cover depicts a figure balancing on a seesaw, 
              weighed down on one side by a heavy bag labeled <span style="font-weight: 600">"1000 Prompts."</span> The figure's head is made up of 
              a stack of three doughnut-like shapes with holes, through which paint is being poured, and it holds a palette 
              and brushes. There's an all-seeing eye in the top left corner, and the figure is saying, "J'accuse!"—a phrase 
              famously associated with Emile Zola, meaning "I accuse!"
              If we consider this image in the context of a person with ADHD, it is interpreted as representing 
              the overload of ideas and the challenge of maintaining balance with such a condition. The "1000 Prompts" could 
              symbolise the myriad of thoughts, tasks, and stimuli that a person with ADHD might be trying to manage at once, 
              making it hard to find equilibrium. The doughnut shapes as the head represents the feeling of having a mind full
               of holes where thoughts and ideas might get lost or escape, and the act of painting could suggest the creative 
               potential that can come from such a flood of ideas. The phrase "J'accuse!" might be the figure's declaration against
                the overwhelming and often judgmental scrutiny they feel, perhaps from society or their own internal critic, 
                regarding their way of processing and expressing thoughts.

            <p>
              Do you persevere, or have these struggles defeated you.<br />
              Do you envision, or have these delusions misguided you.
            </p>

            <p>
              Why do you seek something external to yourself,<br />
              Are you too concerned with what was and what will be.
            </p>

            <p>
              If I pushed you down that cliff, would you be able to climb
              again.<br />
              If I let you through this gate, would you be able to dream
              again.<br />
              Or would you become hollow.
            </p>

            <p>
              Obstacle advances Action,<br />
              Ambition advances Conscience,<br />
              What are you if not consciously acting.
            </p>

            <p>
              Once you pass this gate, there will only be the untrodden,<br />
              Each step will make a mark, on you, as much as where you walk.<br />
              I cannot give you freedom, for you must take it with your own
              hands.
            </p>

            <p>
              Beyond this gate, none will oppose you,<br />

            <p>
              A day of fear is here my face white as a ghost.<br />
              She smiles at me, and she takes my hand, as she brings me to my
              seat.<br />
              I would love to have friends of my own,<br />
              but I only have my family,<br />
              there's something about me that this classroom doesn't see,<br />
              A happy loving guy just watching life go by, but is he
              actually,<br />
              or is he just putting it on for show?<br />
              look at me what do you see!<br />
              I might do things at a slower pace,<br />
              but life isn't always a race.<br />
              The struggles been real,<br />
              but I just had to deal.<br />
              Secondary school wasn't great because I never had a mate.<br />
              But a new chapter begins.<br />
              I'll keep fighting and hope to see.<br />
              That all people with disabilities will get opportunities like
              me.<br />
              I count myself lucky to be one of the few that get to go to
              Trinity.

  </h2>
  <p>
    Steep, cracked, and jagged, it stands,<br />
    Taller than the clouds, wider than the seas.<br />
    The night sky looms overhead, yet there are no stars,<br />
    While dark and grey clouds slip down its rough edges.<br />
    The only light peeks from within the cracks along its face,<br />
    As if trying to reach out its arms to me.
  </p>

 
  <p class="emphasized-text">
    All I know is that I must climb.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even if I lose grip and slip,<br />
    Even if debris comes crashing down,<br />
    Even if my hands bruise, my bones crack, my arms tear,<br />
    I must keep my hold.
  </p>

              Gatekeeper (2019) ~ by Faolán Doecke Launders
            </h2>
            <p>
              A place of hope, a place of dreams, Lies behind the gateway.<br />
              Guarded by him, He who stands at the edge of the abyss.<br />
              The one which we all climb from.
            </p>

            <p>
              Upon reaching the gate, I first saw him.<br />
              While others passed the gate, I was stopped,<br />
              By him.
            </p>

            <p>
              His body devours light, Only his bleak outline can be seen.<br />
              His lifeless eyes fixated on you, With a sword in his hand.<br />
              He guards the gateway.
            </p>

            <p>
              When I try to pass, He shoves me back.<br />
              When I try to run, He hunts me down.<br />
              When I try to fight, He strikes me last.
            </p>

            <p>
              He lets all others pass him, He is only focused on me.<br />
              He knows my every move, No matter what I try.
            </p>

            <p>
              I asked him his name once, Grinning with razor teeth,<br />
              He looks me in the eye, Pulls off his cloak,<br />
              Revealing his face to me.
            </p>

            <p>
              It was at that moment, That I understood.<br />
              For the face that I saw, Was my very own.
            </p>

            <p>
              Then I remembered,<br />
              Told to me by my kin.<br />
              Our only true enemy,<br />
              Is the one within.

                      </h2>
                      <p>
                        Having access to my community,<br />
                        For a person with a disability,<br /> 
                        Means I can participate to the best of my ability. 
                      </p>
          
                      <p>
                        Recently I discovered Crann, <br />
                          A place where I can go for a chat, <br />
                          Over a cup of tea or coffee, <br />
                          And some sweet snacks. 
                      </p>
          
                      <p>
                        Crann designed Ireland's first fully accessible playground & leisure area,  <br />
                        For people with Neuro-physical disabilities, <br />
                        As they saw the world needed to open more opportunities, <br />
                        To allow us to come together as one in our communities. <br />
                        Before I began my time in Trinity, <br />
                        I applied for a job in my local community. <br />
                        It was in a café that employs people with intellectual disabilities,<br />
                        but I was told I would not be employed,<br />
                        as I did not fit their description of a person with a disability.
                      </p>
          
                      <p>
                        So, my journey from Cork to Dublin was meant to be, <br />
                        As there was no suitable 3rd level education for me. <br />
                        I didn't think I passed my interview, <br />
                        As at this point, I was totally lost in my capabilities. 
                      </p>
          
                      <p>
                        The Trinity panel saw something in me, <br />
                        Now I am part of their community.  
                      </p>
          
                      <p>
                        As time goes on,  <br />
                        I began to see, <br />
                        That I can do whatever I want, <br />
                        With some readjustments, <br />
                        I will succeed.

            <h3>Rhys Merriman</h3>
            <p>
              People with disabilities have their rights affected everyday. For instance People in wheelchairs might not have access
              to shops, transportation and schools. Most public transport only has space for one wheelchair on it.
              People who travel on planes for a holiday will have to organise for someone to meet them at the end of their flight
              to help them off the plane. Sometimes there are extreme delays and they can be left sitting on the plane
              for an hour. People in wheelchairs have the right to live their lives as normal as possible. They should not
              have obstacles in their way.
            </p>
            <p>
              I try to translate the people in wheelchairs of trying to 
              know how they can live like other people and how they can overcome any sorts of obstacles that get in their 
              way even knowing how they can handle any sort of situations that they get into and how they can cope with it.
            </p>

                      <p>
                        Memories with no sound,<br />
                        But just fleeting images<br />
                        Blurred by bitterness and lockdown,<br />
                        Begin to clog up the drain of my brain,<br />
                        Whose waterlogged streets swerve<br />
                        And serve as a pool of regrets.
                      </p>
          
                      <p>
                        Friends with no faces,<br />
                        But just acts of sentiment<br />
                        That ripple through a lifetime,<br />
                        All run for office in my lawless heart,<br />
                        Whose navigation systems crashed<br />
                        A long pandemic ago.

                      </p>
          
                      <p>
                        Tears with no reason,<br />
                        But just silver discharge<br />
                        From the soul's invisible cyst,<br />
                        Alight on the poet's warm cheeks,<br />
                        Whose tension makes them solid rocks<br />
                        In the wake of raw anxiety.                     
                      </p>

                       <p>
                        Your name is but a whisper in the storm—<br />
                        Your favourite things, these paternoster lakes<br />
                        Obscured by hills of Himalayan form,<br />
                        Their peaks topped with citadels of snowflakes.<br />
                        Your blonde hair, remnants of a desert sun<br />
                        To which our great ancestors once succumbed—<br />
                        Your blue eyes, brazen as a sea demon<br />
                        With bright venom that has my conscience numbed.<br />
                        Your skin, a holy reservoir of light—<br />
                        This ceaseless night, a stadium of dreams—<br />
                        Your face skimming cesspools of time - its slight<br />
                        Solemnity diverges at the seams.<br />
                        Your voice is an empire of mandolins<br />
                        That marches through the mire of all my sins.
                       </p>

                        Recalling the Dark Summer of '21 ~ by Ben Rowesome
                     </h3>
                       <p>
                        I have lived through god-awful times<br />
                        When my own anxiety seeks asylum<br />
                        From the rest of the body, and others' crimes<br />
                        That I've been convinced are my problem <br />
                        Are a deadweight through this pandemic.<br />
                        All my primary signals are jammed<br />
                        (Now I can't even study without getting sick),<br />
                        And all bloody week my nerves are slammed—<br />
                        Swelling to the size of lurid leaches<br />
                        Before the semester is even out,<br />
                        And sucking the summer out of beaches<br />
                        To pour in a thick sense of doubt.<br />
                        Time is a sinkhole, belching deaths<br />
                        In macabre demographics and newsflashes,<br />
                        Fed through the fear of shorter breaths<br />
                        And the death notes my ego cashes.<br />
                        I have lived through god-awful times<br />
                        When my own sordid premonitions come forward<br />
                        And drag me through a forest of chimes<br />
                        That whisper this through the floorboards;<br />
                        “You have nothing left to give now—<br />
                        Your creel is empty, no dreams to scale.<br />
                        All there is left to do is breathlessly bow<br />
                        To the Wraiths who Eternally Inhale!”

    <h3>Personal Things ~ by Kathleen O'Leary (Plain text Version)</h3>
    <p>
      He carries my personal things in his pocket-<br />
      A lipstick, a mirror, my comb;<br />
      Reflecting the ease of a long shared communion<br />
      Often wordless but echoed in song;<br />
      We lit the same tune through our lifetime<br />
      Celebrating the years that have flown-<br />
      He carries my personal things in his pocket<br />
      But his heart's where my dreams have come <strong><i>home</i></strong>
