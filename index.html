              <p>
                Art transcends boundaries and speaks a universal language
                understood by all. It's a powerful tool that connects diverse
                communities, celebrates unique perspectives, and embraces
                inclusivity. We believe art should be accessible to everyone,
                regardless of background, ability, or circumstance. It's not
                just about viewing art; it's about experiencing it, creating it,
                and being part of a community that values every voice.

              Do you persevere, or have these struggles defeated you.<br />
              Do you envision, or have these delusions misguided you.
            </p>

            <p>
              Why do you seek something external to yourself,<br />
              Are you too concerned with what was and what will be.
            </p>

            <p>
              If I pushed you down that cliff, would you be able to climb
              again.<br />
              If I let you through this gate, would you be able to dream
              again.<br />
              Or would you become hollow.

              Obstacle advances Action,<br />
              Ambition advances Conscience,<br />
              What are you if not consciously acting.
            </p>

            <p>
              Once you pass this gate, there will only be the untrodden,<br />
              Each step will make a mark, on you, as much as where you walk.<br />
              I cannot give you freedom, for you must take it with your own
              hands.
            </p>

            <p>
              Beyond this gate, none will oppose you,<br />
              Because you have no enemies

              by Alex Martin
            </h2>
            <p>
              A day of fear is here my face white as a ghost.<br />
              She smiles at me, and she takes my hand, as she brings me to my
              seat.<br />
              I would love to have friends of my own,<br />
              but I only have my family,<br />
              there's something about me that this classroom doesn't see,<br />
              A happy loving guy just watching life go by, but is he
              actually,<br />
              or is he just putting it on for show?<br />
              look at me what do you see!<br />
              I might do things at a slower pace,<br />
              but life isn't always a race.<br />
              The struggles been real,<br />
              but I just had to deal.<br />
              Secondary school wasn't great because I never had a mate.<br />
              But a new chapter begins.<br />
              I'll keep fighting and hope to see.<br />
              That all people with disabilities will get opportunities like
              me.<br />
              I count myself lucky to be one of the few that get to go to
              Trinity.

              <span style="font-weight: 600; color: #b870ff">#4 </span> That I
              Must Climb ~ by Faolán Doecke Launders
            </h2>
            <p>
              Steep, cracked, and jagged, it stands,<br />
              Taller than the clouds, wider than the seas.<br />
              The night sky looms overhead, yet there are no stars,<br />
              While dark and grey clouds slip down its rough edges.<br />
              The only light peeks from within the cracks along its face,<br />
              As if trying to reach out its arms to me
            </p>

            <p>All I know is that I must climb.</p>

            <p>
              Even if I lose grip and slip,<br />
              Even if debris comes crashing down,<br />
              Even if my hands bruise, my bones crack, my arms tear,<br />
              I must keep my hold.
            </p>

            <p>
              When does this end, where does this even bring me.<br />
              Why must I climb at all.<br />
              As I climb, I begin to lose myself,<br />
              Until I find a crack of light, a window of brightness that pierces
              from the other side,<br />
              When I look in, I see everyone, I see you, peaceful, joyful,<br />
              Yet you do not look back at me, you cannot see me,<br />
              It is then that I find myself, and I recall why I am here, and why
              I am climbing at all,
            </p>

            <p>
              So that one day, I can reach this summit,<br />
              And on that day,<br />
              I will finally be able to truly say Hello,<br />
              I will finally be able to Laugh and Live,<br />
              I will finally be able to be the best version of myself
            </p>

            <p>
              And all that I hope, is that when I see you on that summit,<br />
              You’ll still be there to say Hello back.
            </p>

            <p>Just a little more...</p>

            <p>...that I must climb.</p>

            <p>
              So please wait a little longer for me, okay?<br />
              I just have to climb some more.

              Gatekeeper ~ by Faolán Doecke Launders
            </h2>
            <p>
              A place of hope, a place of dreams, Lies behind the gateway.<br />
              Guarded by him, He who stands at the edge of the abyss.<br />
              The one which we all climb from.
            </p>

            <p>
              Upon reaching the gate, I first saw him.<br />
              While others passed the gate, I was stopped,<br />
              By him.
            </p>

            <p>
              His body devours light, Only his bleak outline can be seen.<br />
              His lifeless eyes fixated on you, With a sword in his hand.<br />
              He guards the gateway.
            </p>

            <p>
              When I try to pass, He shoves me back.<br />
              When I try to run, He hunts me down.<br />
              When I try to fight, He strikes me last.
            </p>

            <p>
              He lets all others pass him, He is only focused on me.<br />
              He knows my every move, No matter what I try.
            </p>

            <p>
              I asked him his name once, Grinning with razor teeth,<br />
              He looks me in the eye, Pulls off his cloak,<br />
              Revealing his face to me.
            </p>

            <p>
              It was at that moment, That I understood.<br />
              For the face that I saw, Was my very own.
            </p>

            <p>
              Then I remembered,<br />
              Told to me by my kin.<br />
              Our only true enemy,<br />
              Is the one within.
