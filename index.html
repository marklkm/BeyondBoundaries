              <h3>Art Unleashed</h3>
              <p>
                Art transcends boundaries and speaks a universal language
                understood by all. It's a powerful tool that connects diverse
                communities, celebrates unique perspectives, and embraces
                inclusivity. We believe art should be accessible to everyone,
                regardless of background, ability, or circumstance. It's not
                just about viewing art; it's about experiencing it, creating it,
                and being part of a community that values every voice.

                >DESCRIPTION "Sorry for my late reply":</span
              >
              The cover features a figure in a top hat reclining on a chaise
              lounge, a thought bubble with the words
              <span style="font-weight: 600">"Sorry for my late reply"</span>
              above their head. The surroundings are surreal, with a swirling
              vortex on the left and floating, disjoined checkerboard patterns.
              This image is interpreted as representing the inner experience of
              someone with ADHD, where time management and the ability to
              respond promptly can be a challenge. The swirling vortex may
              symbolise the whirlwind of thoughts and distractions that can lead
              to procrastination or delayed responses. The checkerboard
              elements, defying gravity and order, represents the non-linear
              thinking and difficulty in maintaining task structure that
              individuals with ADHD often experience. The discarded tissues
              indicates past efforts or attempts to address issues that haven't
              quite succeeded, adding to the sense of chaos and disarray. The
              overall composition conveys a sense of waiting, contemplation, and
              the disjointed passage of time.

                >DESCRIPTION "Artificial Intelligence":</span
              >
              The cover portrays a caricatured hand holding a bottle labeled
              <span style="font-weight: 600">"Artificial Intelligence"</span>
              which is being poured over a computer that appears overwhelmed or
              malfunctioning, with its contents spilling out uncontrollably.
              This could be seen as a metaphor for the experience of a person
              with ADHD, where the AI symbolises a flood of information or
              stimuli. Just as the computer is unable to contain the influx from
              the bottle, an individual with ADHD might feel similarly inundated
              by sensory input or rapid thoughts, struggling to filter and
              process them effectively. The scattered components and the
              unplugged cable might represent the challenges of organising tasks
              and staying connected to a single activity or thought process. The
              "J'accuse!" speech bubble implies an accusation or calling out,
              possibly alluding to the critical discourse on the impact of AI or
              to the inner criticism that individuals with ADHD might confront
              when managing their symptoms.

              <span style="font-weight: 600">DESCRIPTION "1000 Prompts":</span>
              The cover depicts a figure balancing on a seesaw, weighed down on
              one side by a heavy bag labeled
              <span style="font-weight: 600">"1000 Prompts."</span> The figure's
              head is made up of a stack of three doughnut-like shapes with
              holes, through which paint is being poured, and it holds a palette
              and brushes. There's an all-seeing eye in the top left corner, and
              the figure is saying, "J'accuse!"—a phrase famously associated
              with Emile Zola, meaning "I accuse!" If we consider this image in
              the context of a person with ADHD, it is interpreted as
              representing the overload of ideas and the challenge of
              maintaining balance with such a condition. The "1000 Prompts"
              could symbolise the myriad of thoughts, tasks, and stimuli that a
              person with ADHD might be trying to manage at once, making it hard
              to find equilibrium. The doughnut shapes as the head represents
              the feeling of having a mind full of holes where thoughts and
              ideas might get lost or escape, and the act of painting could
              suggest the creative potential that can come from such a flood of
              ideas. The phrase "J'accuse!" might be the figure's declaration
              against the overwhelming and often judgmental scrutiny they feel,
              perhaps from society or their own internal critic, regarding their
              way of processing and expressing thoughts.

              Do you persevere, or have these struggles defeated you.<br />
              Do you envision, or have these delusions misguided you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Why do you seek something external to yourself,<br />
              Are you too concerned with what was and what will be.
            </p>
            <p>
              If I pushed you down that cliff, would you be able to climb

              If I let you through this gate, would you be able to dream
              again.<br />

            <p>
              A day of fear is here my face white as a ghost.<br />
              She smiles at me, and she takes my hand, as she brings me to my
              seat.<br />
              I would love to have friends of my own,<br />
              but I only have my family,<br />
              there's something about me that this classroom doesn't see,<br />
              A happy loving guy just watching life go by, but is he
              actually,<br />
              or is he just putting it on for show?<br />
              look at me what do you see!<br />
              I might do things at a slower pace,<br />
              but life isn't always a race.<br />
              The struggles been real,<br />
              but I just had to deal.<br />
              Secondary school wasn't great because I never had a mate.<br />
              But a new chapter begins.<br />
              I'll keep fighting and hope to see.<br />
              That all people with disabilities will get opportunities like
              me.<br />
              I count myself lucky to be one of the few that get to go to
              Trinity.

              The only light peeks from within the cracks along its face,<br />

                  Gatekeeper (2019) ~ by Faolán Doecke Launders
                </h2>
                <p>
                  A place of hope, a place of dreams, Lies behind the
                  gateway.<br />
                  Guarded by him, He who stands at the edge of the abyss.<br />
                  The one which we all climb from.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Upon reaching the gate, I first saw him.<br />
                  While others passed the gate, I was stopped,<br />
                  By him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  His body devours light, Only his bleak outline can be seen.<br />
                  His lifeless eyes fixated on you, With a sword in his hand.<br />
                  He guards the gateway.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When I try to pass, He shoves me back.<br />
                  When I try to run, He hunts me down.<br />
                  When I try to fight, He strikes me last.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He lets all others pass him, He is only focused on me.<br />
                  He knows my every move, No matter what I try.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I asked him his name once, Grinning with razor teeth,<br />
                  He looks me in the eye, Pulls off his cloak,<br />
                  Revealing his face to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was at that moment, That I understood.<br />
                  For the face that I saw, Was my very own.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then I remembered,<br />
                  Told to me by my kin.<br />
                  Our only true enemy,<br />
                  Is the one within.

                  Having access to my community,<br />
                  For a person with a disability,<br />
                  Means I can participate to the best of my ability.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Recently I discovered Crann,<br />
                  A place where I can go for a chat,<br />
                  Over a cup of tea or coffee,<br />
                  And some sweet snacks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Crann designed Ireland's first fully accessible playground &
                  leisure area,<br />
                  For people with Neuro-physical disabilities,<br />
                  As they saw the world needed to open more opportunities,<br />
                  To allow us to come together as one in our communities.<br />
                  Before I began my time in Trinity,<br />
                  I applied for a job in my local community.<br />
                  It was in a café that employs people with intellectual
                  disabilities,<br />
                  but I was told I would not be employed,<br />
                  as I did not fit their description of a person with a
                  disability.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, my journey from Cork to Dublin was meant to be,<br />
                  As there was no suitable 3rd level education for me.<br />
                  I didn't think I passed my interview,<br />
                  As at this point, I was totally lost in my capabilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Trinity panel saw something in me,<br />
                  Now I am part of their community.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As time goes on,<br />
                  I began to see,<br />
                  That I can do whatever I want,<br />
                  With some readjustments,<br />
                  I will succeed.

                <h3>Rhys Merriman</h3>
                <p>
                  People with disabilities have their rights affected everyday.
                  For instance People in wheelchairs might not have access to
                  shops, transportation and schools. Most public transport only
                  has space for one wheelchair on it. People who travel on
                  planes for a holiday will have to organise for someone to meet
                  them at the end of their flight to help them off the plane.
                  Sometimes there are extreme delays and they can be left
                  sitting on the plane for an hour. People in wheelchairs have
                  the right to live their lives as normal as possible. They
                  should not have obstacles in their way.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I try to translate the people in wheelchairs of trying to know
                  how they can live like other people and how they can overcome
                  any sorts of obstacles that get in their way even knowing how
                  they can handle any sort of situations that they get into and
                  how they can cope with it.

                  Memories with no sound,<br />
                  But just fleeting images<br />
                  Blurred by bitterness and lockdown,<br />
                  Begin to clog up the drain of my brain,<br />
                  Whose waterlogged streets swerve<br />
                  And serve as a pool of regrets.

                  Friends with no faces,<br />
                  But just acts of sentiment<br />
                  That ripple through a lifetime,<br />
                  All run for office in my lawless heart,<br />
                  Whose navigation systems crashed<br />
                  A long pandemic ago.

                  Tears with no reason,<br />
                  But just silver discharge<br />
                  From the soul's invisible cyst,<br />
                  Alight on the poet's warm cheeks,<br />
                  Whose tension makes them solid rocks<br />
                  In the wake of raw anxiety.

                  Your name is but a whisper in the storm—<br />
                  Your favourite things, these paternoster lakes<br />
                  Obscured by hills of Himalayan form,<br />
                  Their peaks topped with citadels of snowflakes.<br />
                  Your blonde hair, remnants of a desert sun<br />
                  To which our great ancestors once succumbed—<br />
                  Your blue eyes, brazen as a sea demon<br />
                  With bright venom that has my conscience numbed.<br />
                  Your skin, a holy reservoir of light—<br />
                  This ceaseless night, a stadium of dreams—<br />
                  Your face skimming cesspools of time - its slight<br />
                  Solemnity diverges at the seams.<br />
                  Your voice is an empire of mandolins<br />
                  That marches through the mire of all my sins.

                <p>
                  I have lived through god-awful times<br />
                  When my own anxiety seeks asylum<br />
                  From the rest of the body, and others' crimes<br />
                  That I've been convinced are my problem<br />
                  Are a deadweight through this pandemic.<br />
                  All my primary signals are jammed<br />
                  (Now I can't even study without getting sick),<br />
                  And all bloody week my nerves are slammed—<br />
                  Swelling to the size of lurid leaches<br />
                  Before the semester is even out,<br />
                  And sucking the summer out of beaches<br />
                  To pour in a thick sense of doubt.<br />
                  Time is a sinkhole, belching deaths<br />
                  In macabre demographics and newsflashes,<br />
                  Fed through the fear of shorter breaths<br />
                  And the death notes my ego cashes.<br />
                  I have lived through god-awful times<br />
                  When my own sordid premonitions come forward<br />
                  And drag me through a forest of chimes<br />
                  That whisper this through the floorboards;<br />
                  “You have nothing left to give now—<br />
                  Your creel is empty, no dreams to scale.<br />
                  All there is left to do is breathlessly bow<br />
                  To the Wraiths who Eternally Inhale!”

                      into my soul<br />
                      long red cuts<br />

                  Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) is a mental health condition
                  where a person spends a lot of time worrying about flaws in
                  their appearance. This condition can significantly affect
                  one's life, leading to severe emotional distress and impacting
                  their ability to function daily.

                <h3>Handcrafted Blankets</h3>
                <p class="text">
                  This exquisite double bed blanket is not only a unique piece
                  of art but also a deeply personal expression of tranquility
                  and control. Handcrafted with meticulous care, it embodies the
                  therapeutic journey of its creator, an autistic college
                  student, who found solace in the rhythmic creation of crochet
                  squares during times of chaos. Each blanket is a one-of-a-kind
                  creation, ensuring no two are ever alike. The repetitive
                  nature of crafting granny squares brings a comforting sense of
                  order, while the additional weight of the blanket offers a
                  sensory benefit, providing a soothing embrace that enhances
                  the calmness of night. This piece is a testament to the
                  soothing power of repetitive crafting and a celebration of the
                  joy found in the creation of orderly patterns and tactile
                  comfort.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They were all made during my time at TCD, each double blanket
                  took about three months to make. I find crochet very soothing
                  and love the repetition, but I've always had a thing about
                  square numbers and symmetry so I found making the blankets and
                  finishing each one was a really healthy way to express some of
                  my obsessive / repetitive behaviours in a very positive and
                  healthy way, and at the end you have a very cosy blanket to
                  snuggle up in, which is heavy enough to have tactile sensory
                  benefits. After displaying at the art expo they will be
                  available to purchase at the Michaelmas Market (along with
                  sheep and some other goodies!).
